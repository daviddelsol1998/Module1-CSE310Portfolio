# Overview

This repo contains an exploratory programming project written using Python:
The purpose of this program is to provide a desktop application that will help the user set up an automatic budget based the total income received each week. The program requests the user to input how much income was received then it records the answer in a txt file and display how much needs to be paid in tithing, how much will go to savings and then it will divide the remaining money into different categories so that there is a clearly defined budget for each category.

The stretch part will be reading and writing from a file to show previous weekâ€™s budgets and also creating a decent software interface.

These projects are inteded to explore the syntax of python including:
Variables, Expressions, Conditionals, Loops, Functions, Classes, and Data structures (e.g. list, tuple, dict, or set).

As for now the first project in the repo, for testing purposes is "hello world" and it is posted as "hello_world.py" at the root of the repository. 

The program simply outputs the string "hello world" to the terminal.

Here is a demostration of the program in action:

# Development Environment

For this program I am using VS code as it is my preferred IDE, I am also using git for my version control integration.
The program is written in Python3
